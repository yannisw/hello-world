# hello-world
Hello friends, I am new to coding, and this is my first post here. Keen to learn :)

2017 is going to be a year of fun and challenges. I will be breaking out of the non-productiveness that was from procrastination, of not knowing where my interests lie. I will learn new things, and explore on the things that I will enjoy.

I have always thought that coding was for geeks, but after taking my first computer science course, which was CS50 on edx, it feels like it is filling up part of the empty whole that was inside me. I enjoyed solving problems from maths classes, and coding fills this. I like the feeling of being able to build things while solving problems. This spells fun, challenges, and productivity!

I wish everyone a great coding journey!

Yannis
